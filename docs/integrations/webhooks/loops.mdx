- Sync Clerk users to your Loops audience and send automated emails.

</TutorialHero>

This tutorial demonstrates how to sync your Clerk users to Loops so you can email users using Loop's email marketing tools. You will also learn how to send email sequences to new Clerk users.

<Steps>

### Create a Clerk webhook endpoint in Loops

Loops' [Incoming webhooks](https://loops.so/docs/integrations/incoming-webhooks) feature lets Loops accept webhooks directly from external platforms like Clerk.

To create a new webhook endpoint in Loops:
1.  Navigate to the [Loops dashboard](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=clerk).
1. In the sidebar, select **Settings > Clerk**
1. Save the **Endpoint URL** somewhere secure; you're going to need it for Clerk's webhook configuration.

### Create a webhook in Clerk

Now go to Clerk and create a new endpoint so Clerk can send data to Loops.

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks).
2. In the navigation sidenav, select **Webhooks**.
3. Select the **Add Endpoint** button.
4. In the **Endpoint URL** field, paste the endpoint URL from Loops.
5. In the **Message Filtering** section, select the `user.created` and/or `user.updated` events, depending on your desired setup.
6. Select the **Create** button.
7. You will be redirected to your endpoint's settings page. Leave this page open.

### Add your Signing secret in Loops

To keep communication secure between the two platforms, you need to copy the signing secret created by Clerk for your endpoint.

You can copy this by selecting the eye icon on your endpoint's settings page.

Back in Loops, paste this signing secret in the **Signing Secret** field.

### Configure events

The final step is to configure which events Loops should accept from Clerk and what Loops should do with the data.

Toggle on the events you selected in Clerk in step 2. Doing this will sync your Clerk users to Loops when they are created or updated in Clerk.

You can optionally choose to trigger a "[loop](https://loops.so/docs/loop-builder)" when new webhooks are sent to Loops, by selecting an event in the **Trigger an event** field. This is useful, for example, if you want to send an email welcome sequence to new Clerk users.

You can also choose to assign a user group value for each Clerk user, which will help you organise and segment contacts in Loops.
